# ridge-nucleotide-predictions

I wrote most of this in the Fall of 2015 at BYU.

This is a model which incorporates most supervised-learning classifiers to determine non-random nucleotide associations. 

>70% prediction accuracy was found for many regions in the genome.

I used the GRCh37/hg19 human genome reference.
